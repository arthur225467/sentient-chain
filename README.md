# sentient-chain
A proposal for an AI-responsive blockchain protocol with built-in smart contract defense, fallback logic, and decentralized intelligence.
Sentient Chain
AIRD: AI-Responsive Decentralization
An experimental blockchain protocol powered by artificial intelligence logic.

Overview
Sentient Chain is a blockchain concept designed around a new type of intelligence layer called AIRD (AI-Responsive Decentralization).
It introduces AI-powered smart contract logic, automated defense mechanisms, and decentralized fallback strategies to improve trust and coordination on-chain.

Key Features
AI-Driven Contract Defense
Contracts can detect abnormal behavior (like front-running, sniping, or manipulation) and respond automatically.

Fallback Logic
When contract logic fails or conditions change, AI logic can activate safe modes, limit access, or redirect flows.

Decentralized Intelligence
Instead of a central AI, the system relies on logic distributed across multiple smart contracts and nodes.

Anti-Whale & Anti-Bot Logic
Contracts can analyze wallet behavior in real-time and dynamically adjust token privileges.

Trust Scoring System
Behavior-based reputation for wallets, feeding into contract access permissions.

Vision
To build a more intelligent, adaptive blockchain layer where AI helps enforce fairness, decentralization, and safety — without compromising core crypto values.

Roadmap
 Publish full concept paper

 Create testnet smart contract prototypes

 Experiment with AI-to-contract triggers using Chainlink Functions or similar

 Build open governance model for AIRD logic updates
