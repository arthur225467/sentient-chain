# AIRD: AI-Responsive Decentralization Logic

Sentient Chain introduces AIRD — a new logic layer where smart contracts actively respond to real-time events using AI analysis.

## Core Concepts

- **AI Defense Mechanism:**  
  Contracts can monitor abnormal wallet behavior (whale activity, bots, manipulation) and trigger automatic actions like cooldowns, transaction rejection, or emergency rerouting.

- **Fallback Logic:**  
  If the main contract fails or detects malicious input, AI triggers a backup logic state or reroutes tokens to a safe pool.

- **Trust Scoring:**  
  Wallets and contracts are scored in real-time using decentralized logic-based AI oracles that rate interactions, volatility, and on-chain footprint.

- **AI Oracles:**  
  Feeds behavior data, time-based analysis, and predictive actions into smart contracts — e.g., market pattern detection, dump prevention, AI-curated governance alerts.

This is the first logic layer. More coming soon — governance, defense scoring, and dynamic liquidity logic.
